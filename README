Project contains three files:

* micro_design.csv - barcode design
* clusters.csv - read_id and barcode for ground truth (ground truth defined and limited by hadas using maximal distance) 
* signal_seq_dict.csv - clustering data

The file signal_seq_dict is huge and was therefore compressed.
Sub-folders "zip" and "7zip" are two compressions of same said file - use whichever is most convenient. Both compression-types are multi-volume. 
Each file is accompanied by an .md5 hash file to ensure data integrity.
